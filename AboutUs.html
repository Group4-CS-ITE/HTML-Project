    <p class="About">
        &nbsp Sizzla began with a shared dream among four passionate individuals to bring the warmth and authenticity of Filipino cuisine straight to every Filipino’s doorstep. What started as a humble local restaurant soon grew into a nationwide sensation, fueled by dedication, innovation, and a deep love for Filipino food.
